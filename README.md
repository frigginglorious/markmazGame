2D HTML5 Canvas-based JavaScript Sidescroller
---------------------------------------------

Nothing too fancy so far. No support for enemy AI or collision detection yet in the engine, that's coming (hopefully along with a decent class organization overhaul) before the next push. Currently blobbed into one large file for quick JSMin/JSLint feeding (which is not in particularly good state at the moment...improvements coming there too).

Where can I try this out?
